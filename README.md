To save all the installed packages in your virtual environment to a `requirements.txt` file, you'll use the `pip freeze` command. This command outputs a list of all the installed packages and their specific versions in the environment.

Here's how to do it:

1. First, ensure that your virtual environment is activated. If it's not activated, you can do so using:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `source venv_name/bin/activate`
   - **Windows**: `.\venv_name\Scripts\activate`

2. Once the virtual environment is active, run the following command:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
This will generate a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory with all the dependencies listed.

3. If you check the contents of `requirements.txt`, you'll see something like:
```
Django==3.x.x
...
```
The exact packages and versions will depend on what's installed in your virtual environment.

4. When you need to set up the project on a different machine or environment, you can use the `requirements.txt` file to install all the necessary packages with the exact versions specified. Simply run:
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Remember, always keep your `requirements.txt` updated when you add new packages to your project, as this ensures consistency across different development and production environments.
